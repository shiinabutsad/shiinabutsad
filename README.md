#### Hi there, I'm Akın 👋

**Computer Programming Student & Aspiring DevOps Engineer**

I love coding, but I have a bigger passion for managing the infrastructure where code lives. Currently, I am bridging the gap between software development and system administration to become a skilled **DevOps Engineer**.

My goal is to master Cloud technologies, Automation, and System Security.
