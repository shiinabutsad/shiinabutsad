### Hi there! I'm Akın 👋

I'm a Computer Programming student on a journey to merge **DevOps agility** with **Cyber Security paranoia**. Currently focused on Cloud Infrastructure, Linux Systems, and Ethical Hacking.

🌱 **I’m currently learning:**
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, S3, VPC management)
- **Security:** Ethical Hacking & Network Security (Kali Linux)
- **OS:** Linux Administration (Ubuntu & Kali)
- **Scripting:** Python & Bash for automation

🎯 **My Goal:**
To become a specialized **DevSecOps Engineer**. I believe security shouldn't be an afterthought, but a part of the pipeline.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**

![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)

⚡ **Fun Fact:**
I enjoy setting up servers on AWS just to see how secure I can make them (or how fast I can break them).
